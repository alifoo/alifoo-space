    <h2>Academic information</h2>
<div class="paragraphs">
	<p>I'm currently in my second semester of Computer Science at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontifical_Catholic_University_of_Paran%C3%A1"><b>Pontifical Catholic University of Paran√° (PUC-PR)</b></a>, one of Brazil's most well-known universities. Right after starting university, I began working towards becoming a Dean's list student.</p>
	<p>I founded the <a href="https://blogs.pucpr.br/identidade/2024/03/14/clubes-universitarios-faca-parte-faca-amigos/#:~:text=CLUBE%20DE%20HACKING,Alisson%20(41)%20992488366"><b>Hacking Club</b></a>, a creative problem-solving group focused on programming. My friend Marcos and I teach algortihms and data structures to any interested student. We also plan on introducting topics like software architecture and design patterns soon. We have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@hacking-club-pucpr"><b>YouTube channel</b></a> and a <a href="https://github.com/alifoo/hacking-club-pucpr"><b>GitHub</b></a> repository where all lectures will be posted, if you're interested.</p>
	<p>Besides the club, I also created de <b>GDA (Deepening Group)</b>, which offers weekly workshops on job-relevant skills such as Git, Linux, and various technologies. This workshop is not open to the public, as the university considers it voluntary mentoring I provide. However, you can check our <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gda.pucpr/"><b>Instagram page</b></a> to see past sessions and the topics covered.</p>
	<p>I am also an active member of the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/clubedeoratoria_pucpr/"><b>Public Speaking Club</b></a>. I recognize that, even though I'm in a highly technical field, communication is equally important. This is why I dedicate myself to participating in the club's discussions and presentations.</p>
	<p>Additionally, I'm participating in <a href="https://www.pucpr.br/iniciacaocientificaetecnologica/pibep/"><b>PIBEP (Institutional Entrepreneurship and Research Scholarship Program of PUC-PR)</b></a>, a program that allows students to launch products and receive university funding. My team is building <b>Cosmopeer</b>, a language learning app that leverages Artificial Intelligente to adapt reading material to various proficiency levels.</p>
	<p>For example, a C1 text can be transformed into a B1 version, allowing students to consume relevant information while being appropriately challenged. I'm responsible for all the technology involved, with a focus on architecture and backend.</p>
