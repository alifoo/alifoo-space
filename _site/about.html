    <h2>About me (and this website)</h2>
<div class="paragraphs">
	<p>You can call me Ali. I'm currently a CS student and a software engineer. I created this page because I found that the way I think about learning is particularly useful. If I feel demotivated to continue, I try to look at my trees, by reflecting on what I've built until now. This abstraction helps me understand that university, programming, competitive programming, etc., are not a quick race. It's a lifelong process.</p>
	<p>By the way, if you're curious, my main trees are: Computer Science, Mathematics, Language and General Knowledge. These are the things that I will focus on the next couple of years. The CS tree is the dominant one, simply because the progress of all the other areas in my life depends on it. However, this does not mean the others are less important.</p>
	<p>If you like the abstraction, feel free to apply it to your own life. The main idea is to create a structure in which you can visualize the progress of your improvement with a simple and clear metric for consistency.</p>
	<p>Also, feel free to contact me and share your results!</p>
