<div class="paragraphs">
  <p>Knowledge can be visualized as a forest, composed of an infinite number of trees. Each tree represents a major category of knowledge. Its branches represent subtopics, and leaves represent specific fields. I visualize skills as fruits that can be obtained from a well-cultivated tree, sustained by a consistent, lifelong learning process.</p>
	<p>The seed displayed depicts my own tree of <b>Computer Science</b>. The number at the top shows each commit made to my GitHub account starting this year. Once the number is reached, the tree will grow.</p>
