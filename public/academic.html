	<p>I'm currently in my second semester of Computer Science at the Pontifical Catholic University of Paran√° (PUC-PR), one of Brazil's most well-known universities. Right after starting university, I began working towards becoming a Dean's list student.</p>
	<p>I founded the Hacking Club, a creative problem-solving group focused on programming. My friend Marcos and I teach algortihms and data structures to any interested student. We also plan on introducting topics like software architecture and design patterns soon. We have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@hacking-club-pucpr">YouTube channel</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/alifoo/hacking-club-pucpr">GitHub</a> repository where all lectures will be posted, if you're interested.</p>
	<p>Besides the club, I also created de GDA (Deepening Group), which offers weekly workshops on job-relevant skills such as Git, Linux, and various technologies. This workshop is not open to the public, as the university considers it voluntary mentoring I provide. However, you can check our Instagram page to see past sessions and the topics covered.</p>
	<p>I am also an active member of the Public Speaking Club. I recognize that, even though I'm in a highly technical field, communication is equally important. This is why I dedicate myself to participating in the club's discussions and presentations.</p>
	<p>Additionally, I'm participating in PIBEP (Institutional Entrepreneurship and Research Scholarship Program of PUC-PR), a program that allows students to launch products and receive university funding. My team is building Cosmopeer, a language learning app that leverages Artificial Intelligente to adapt reading material to various proficiency levels.</p>
	<p>For example, a C1 text can be transformed into a B1 version, allowing students to consume relevant information while being appropriately challenged. I'm responsible for all the technology involved, with a focus on architecture and backend.</p>
